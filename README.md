# RepeatedCharacterInString
Find Most Repeated Character in String and return the number of repeat

• I used Scanner to read a string from command line. 
• Read each character of this string from the first to end.
• Add character to HashMap (if it's new add with number 1 as value otherwise increase the value of the character in HashMap)
• Show the character in HashMap that has max value.
